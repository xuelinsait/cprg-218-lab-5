    <h1>About PostPal</h1>
    <p>PostPal was founded with one simple mission: to bring smiles to people’s faces through beautiful, handcrafted postcards. Each card is designed with love and attention to detail, blending artistic flair with heartfelt messages.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>What started as a small hobby of sketching and designing cards quickly grew into a passionate business. We believe that in a digital world, a handwritten note holds more value than ever. PostPal postcards are created to make every moment memorable—whether it’s a birthday, holiday, or just a simple “thinking of you.”</p>

    <h2>Our Craft</h2>
    <p>From illustration to printing, every step is carefully crafted by our team of designers and artists. We use premium paper, eco-friendly inks, and ensure every card is as unique as the person receiving it.</p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>We’re not just selling postcards—we’re delivering joy, love, and memories. That’s why we put our heart into every piece we create.</p>
